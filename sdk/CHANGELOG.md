# Changelog

All notable changes to the foo-webview-sdk will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.10.0] - 2026-07-16

### Added

- **`TrayMenuItem.orientation`** (`'horizontal' | 'vertical'`) — slider-only
  axis for the WebView tray menu. Default when omitted: horizontal. Only exact
  `'vertical'` is vertical (min bottom / max top; Up/Right increase; Down/Left
  decrease; Home/End edges). Native backends ignore orientation (stepped
  submenu degrade). Older runtimes ignore the unknown key and keep horizontal
  interaction. Range normalization is shared (`max<min` swap, `max==min`
  constant with no value change, initial clamp, IPC out-of-range reject).
  `getMenuItems()` round-trips orientation. Themes that need vertical sliders
  should probe `config.getVersionInfo().plugin.version` first (minimum plugin
  version not finalized — do not hard-code a fake floor). The SDK wrapper
  passes the field through and does not inject a default.
- **`TrayMenuConfig.layoutMode`** (`'flat' | 'zones'`) — opt-in WebView tray DOM
  structure. Default `'flat'` keeps legacy `#menu > .fb-item` direct children.
  `'zones'` emits `.fb-zone[data-zone]` wrappers for non-empty top / playback /
  bottom containers. Native backends ignore the field; older runtimes ignore the
  unknown key without creating wrappers. Public `menu.show` is unaffected.
  Themes that need zones should probe `config.getVersionInfo().plugin.version`
  first (minimum plugin version not finalized — do not hard-code a fake floor).
  Stable CSS hooks: `.fb-menu[data-depth]`, `.fb-zone[data-zone]`,
  `.fb-item[data-item-id|data-kind|data-depth|data-zone]`. `data-item-token` is
  internal and not a public CSS contract.

### Changed

- Self-drawn tray menu accessibility: navigation/editor focus modes with roving
  tabindex and real focus; ARIA for menuitem / menuitemcheckbox / slider /
  radiogroup; `checked: false` remains checkable; default enter/exit animations
  honor `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` (custom CSS is the theme author's
  responsibility; hide protocol / `closeAnimationMs` unchanged).
- Self-drawn menu protected CSS no longer forces visible `#menu { display:block
  !important }`. Themes may set root / zone `display` to flex or grid without
  specificity hacks; hidden menus still cannot be re-shown by user
  `display:* !important`.

### Security

- **Tray / self-drawn menu SVG allowlist** — the `'webview'` menu renderer no
  longer mounts icon markup via raw `innerHTML`. Each `iconSvg` (item and
  segmented option) is parsed with `DOMParser` and cloned through an element /
  attribute allowlist; illegal or oversized icons are dropped and the menu
  continues. There is no “caller already sanitized” bypass. Transform values are
  parsed strictly (no leading/inter-function junk, required arity); live nodes
  must be in the SVG namespace (empty namespace rejected).
- **Tray / self-drawn menu resource preflight** — `tray.setContextMenu`,
  `tray.appendMenuItems`, and `menu.show` now reject oversized menus before any
  persistent tray config is replaced or any overlay is opened. Caps: 512 items,
  `menu.show` depth 8, 64 segmented options, 256 KiB CSS, 256 KiB total SVG
  content. A single SVG over 32 KiB is dropped (menu continues); other breaches
  return `INVALID_PARAMS` with `details: { field, limit, actual }`. Oversized /
  unsafe resource inputs are an intentional incompatibility with previously
  unbounded payloads.
- **Tray action routing fix** — built-ins are routed by trusted internal origin
  metadata instead of public item-id prefixes. The exact, case-sensitive tray
  ID `_sys_exit` remains the documented 1.9.0 compatibility command and exits
  foobar2000. Caller-supplied `_pb_playPause`, `_pb_prev`, `_pb_next`, and
  `_pb_stop` are normal user items and emit `tray:menuItemClicked`; only runtime
  auto-injected playback controls are privileged, and caller items with the same
  IDs do not suppress those injected controls. Similar `_sys_*` IDs and the
  generic `menu.show` API receive no promotion. Selection and rich-value IPC
  still use per-show opaque tokens and validate caller HWND, current menu ID,
  enabled state, control kind, and value range before dispatch.

### Changed

- **`TrayMenuItem.icon` documentation** — corrected the JSDoc: the base64 ICO
  payload is a **reserved field not currently rendered by either backend** (the
  native `TrackPopupMenu` menu is text-only; the `'webview'` menu draws
  `iconSvg`, not this field). Use `iconSvg` for a menu-item icon. No behaviour
  change — the field was already unused by the renderer.

### Fixed

- **`tray:menuItemClicked` for `'segmented'`** — a `'segmented'` pick reports
  `{ id, value }` (the picked zero-based segment index) through the value channel
  and keeps the menu open, matching `'rating'` / `'slider'`. The shared keep-open
  contract and the `TrayMenuItemClickedPayload.value` documentation previously
  listed only `'rating'` / `'slider'`, so a consumer reading the contract could
  treat a segmented pick as a closing click. The `'webview'` runtime already kept
  the menu open; this only aligns the contract and docs with the runtime.
- **Empty tray-menu zones no longer emit an orphan separator** — a menu zone
  whose items are all `visible: false` (or empty) used to leave a leading /
  trailing divider once the hidden items were filtered out downstream. Visible
  filtering now precedes the separator decision, so both the native and
  `'webview'` menus drop the stray separator. Default-behaviour correction.

## [1.9.0] - 2026-06-18

### Added

- **`TrayMenuItem.iconSvg`** — `{ viewBox, content }` inline monochrome SVG icon
  for normal / submenu items, rendered before the label by the `render: 'webview'`
  tray menu only (the native backend ignores it). Drawn with `fill: currentColor`
  so it follows the menu text colour; when any item in a menu layer supplies an
  icon, all normal/submenu items reserve a fixed 16px icon column so labels stay
  left-aligned.
- **`TrayMenuConfig.autoNowPlaying`** — when `true`, `nowplaying` items get any
  empty field (`cover` / `title` / `subtitle`) auto-filled from the current track
  at right-click time (frontend-first, backend-fallback; any value you supply
  wins). `cover` auto-fill is `'webview'`-only and reads the current track's
  front art downscaled to a thumbnail; `title` / `subtitle` use `%title%`
  (filename fallback) / `%artist%`, so live-stream dynamic titles work too.

### Changed

- **`TrayMenuItem.cover`** now also accepts an `http(s)://` URL (in addition to a
  `data:` URL and raw base64) in the `'webview'` tray menu, so streaming
  front-ends can pass a resolved cover URL directly.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-06-10

### Added

- **`fb.menu` self-drawn menus** — `menu.show(...)` / `menu.close()`
  render a context menu inside your own WebView (recursive submenu
  support), so themes can fully style native-style menus instead of
  relying on the OS menu.
- **`fb.tray` owner-mode menu** — the tray context menu now accepts
  `render: 'webview'` so it can be drawn by your WebView, plus
  **`tray.setMenuItemState(...)`** for fine-grained per-item
  enable / check state.

### Fixed

- **Published type bundle lost `HTMLElementTagNameMap` for `fb-*`
  elements.** `rollup-plugin-dts` tree-shook the empty type-only
  `import './generated/global.js'`, dropping the whole `declare global`
  block from `dist/components.d.ts`; npm consumers lost
  `document.createElement('fb-...')` typing and element inference for
  `querySelector` / JSX. The tsup DTS footer now re-injects the
  augmentation so the published `.d.ts` carries it. No source API
  changed.
- **Package root (`foo-webview-sdk`) is now fully typed for runtime
  imports.** The root entry re-exports the aggregate `fb` (default and
  named), every namespace proxy, `bridge` and `state` alongside the
  shared types, so `import fb from 'foo-webview-sdk'` and
  `import { player } from 'foo-webview-sdk'` resolve with full typings.
  Previously only the `foo-webview-sdk/bridge` sub-path carried the
  runtime types while the root resolved to a types-only surface.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-06-06

### Added

- **`fb.taskbar` + `fb.tray` namespaces** — Windows taskbar thumbnail
  toolbar buttons and a system tray icon, including incremental tray
  menu management via the new `TrayMenuConfig` interface.
- **`webview:processFailed` event** — emitted when the WebView2 render
  process crashes or exits, enabling diagnostics and auto-recovery
  handling from the theme side.

### Changed

- **`library.getAll` performance** — cold-cache full serialization is
  now offloaded to a background thread and the redundant double
  deep-copy on cache hits was removed. Large libraries enumerate
  noticeably faster with no API change.

### Fixed

- **`plman.SetPlaylistSelection` (SMP-compat)** no longer ignores the
  host `success` return value. `FbPlaylistView` rating updates no longer
  leave a floating promise.
- 1.7.0 release packaging and generated SDK type fixes.

## [1.6.1] - 2026-05-20

### Added

- **`fb.cursor` namespace** — `cursor.setHidden()` / `cursor.isHidden()`
  plus the `cursor:hiddenChanged` event for cursor visibility control.
- **`fb.http.*` `insecureTls` option** — opt-in (double-gated) bypass of
  TLS certificate verification for development / self-signed endpoints.

### Fixed

- **`fb.http.*` `responseType: 'arraybuffer'`** failing because the
  response was run through strict UTF-8 validation; binary responses now
  pass through unmodified.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-05-11

This release fixes 9 long-standing namespace facade drifts reported from
front-end consumers, adds an internal namespace-coverage audit to guard
against regressions, and ships English defaults for the bundled Web
Components.

### Added

- **`Bridge.setMetricsHook(hook | undefined)`** — install or remove an
  instrumentation hook that fires after every `bridge.invoke()`
  settles, on both the host path and the mock-fallback path. Receives
  a `BridgeInvokeMetrics` snapshot
  (`{ method, durationMs, success, result?, error? }`). Exceptions
  thrown by the hook are caught, logged via `console.warn` (with the
  invoke method name and the original error), and then discarded so
  observability failures cannot destabilise invoke callers.
- **`replaygain.scan(paths, opts?)`** — new optional
  `opts.mode: 'track' | 'album'` controlling whether the scan runs
  per-file track gain or treats the selection as a single album.
- **`rating.set(path, rating, opts?)`** — new optional
  `opts.cueIndex: number` for explicit CUE subsong index (takes
  precedence over `|subsong:N` suffixes in the path).
- **`player.playPaths(paths, options?)`** — accepts either a numeric
  `startIndex` (matching the prior signature) or a
  `{ startIndex?, replace? }` options object. `replace: true` clears
  the active playlist before insertion.
- **`config.setOutputBuffer(value)`** — accepts either numeric
  milliseconds (legacy compatibility) or a
  `{ milliseconds?, bufferLength? }` options object so callers can
  express the buffer in either unit.
- **`REPLAYGAIN_SOURCE_MODE`** constant dictionary and the
  `ReplaygainSourceMode` / `ReplaygainSourceModeName` types — exported
  alongside `config.{get,set}ReplaygainMode` so callers can compare
  against named entries (`REPLAYGAIN_SOURCE_MODE.track`, etc.) instead
  of memorising the integer literals.
- **Internal namespace-coverage audit** — detects drift between
  hand-written namespace facades and generated `*Params` / `*Response`
  interfaces, preventing future facade regressions.
- **`fb.metadata.embedArtwork(path, opts?)`** — new optional fields on
  `opts`:
  - `target: 'embedded' | 'file' | 'all' | string[]` (default
    `'embedded'`) — write into the file's tag container, write a
    sibling image alongside the audio, or both. Solves the long-
    standing CUE limitation where `album_art_editor` rejects the
    container.
  - `filename: string` — override the auto-generated sidecar name
    when `target` includes `'file'`. Path separators and `..` are
    rejected.
  Sidecar naming uses fb2k's default external artwork pattern —
  `front` → `cover.<ext>`, other types → `<type>.<ext>`. The
  extension is inferred from the image magic bytes (JPEG / PNG /
  WebP / GIF / BMP; fallback `.jpg`). CUE / `|subsong:N` paths
  share one sidecar per directory (per-directory model, matches
  fb2k's external artwork lookup). The SDK response type is now
  the generated `MetadataEmbedArtworkResponse` (adds `savedTo`
  and `results`); previous destructures (`{ success, size }`)
  continue to compile.

### Changed (BREAKING)

- **`config.getReplaygainMode()` response shape** — `mode` and
  `value` are now typed as `0 | 1 | 2 | 3` rather than `string`.
  Existing comparisons such as `r.mode === 'track'` no longer
  compile; switch to `r.mode === REPLAYGAIN_SOURCE_MODE.track` or to
  the integer literal directly.
- **`config.setReplaygainMode(mode)` argument type** — accepts
  `ReplaygainSourceMode | ReplaygainSourceModeName` (the integer
  union or the named alias). Arbitrary strings outside the canonical
  alias union now fail to type-check, instead of silently being
  routed to `mode: 0` (none) by the host.
- **`artwork.getFb2kUrl()` / `artwork.getFb2kUrlByPath()` response
  shape** — now returns `ArtworkGetFb2kUrlResponse` /
  `ArtworkGetFb2kUrlByPathResponse` from the generated layer. The
  resolved URL is in the `dataUrl` field, not `url`. The previous
  `<{ url: string }>` annotation on these methods produced
  `r.url === undefined` at runtime; switch to `r.dataUrl`.
- **Bundled Web Components default UI strings switched to English.**
  `FbLibraryTree` / `FbLibraryFilesystemTree` / `FbLyricsPanel` /
  `FbPropertiesPanel` previously rendered Chinese-language placeholders
  (e.g. `所有艺术家`, `(无内容)`, `无歌词`, `编解码器`). They now
  render English defaults (`All Artists`, `(empty)`, `No lyrics`,
  `Codec`, …). Themes that depended on the Chinese copy must override
  the relevant slot or part to restore custom localised text. No
  public component API signature changed; only default text.

### Fixed

- **`Bridge.getNativeFb2k()`** no longer requires
  `window.fb2k._handleResponse` to be defined as a precondition for
  binding the host bridge. The host installs `invoke` and
  `_handleResponse` atomically, so the extra sentinel was redundant
  and rejected legitimate test mocks that only implement the public
  `invoke` / `on` / `off` surface.
- **`config.{get,set}ReplaygainMode`** now exchange data with the
  host in the integer-mode shape it actually expects. The
  earlier SDK silently issued `setReplaygainMode('track')` as
  `{ mode: 'track' }`, which the host parsed as `mode = -1` and
  resolved to `mode = source_mode_none` via the fallback chain —
  effectively turning ReplayGain off for any caller using the named
  string API.

### Migration

`playcount.get` — informational only:
- The earlier SDK's `playcount.get(path)` single-argument variant is
  retained but produces an envelope rather than a bare value. Prefer
  `playcount.getBatch([path])` for new code; the single-argument
  variant remains supported for backwards compatibility.

`artwork.getFb2kUrl`:

```ts
// Before
const r = await fb.artwork.getFb2kUrl();
const src = r.url;       // undefined — silent bug.

// After
const r = await fb.artwork.getFb2kUrl();
const src = r.dataUrl;   // canonical field.
```

`config.{get,set}ReplaygainMode`:

```ts
import { REPLAYGAIN_SOURCE_MODE, fb } from 'foo-webview-sdk';

// Before — silently set mode to 'none' on the host
await fb.config.setReplaygainMode('track');
const r = await fb.config.getReplaygainMode();
if (r.mode === 'track') { /* never true */ }

// After
await fb.config.setReplaygainMode('track');           // OK — named alias
await fb.config.setReplaygainMode(1);                 // OK — integer
const r = await fb.config.getReplaygainMode();
if (r.mode === REPLAYGAIN_SOURCE_MODE.track) { /* matches */ }
```

`Web Components default text`:

If a theme depends on the previous Chinese defaults, override the
relevant slot or part. Each affected component exposes its visible
text through the regular slot / part surface; consult the
component's JSDoc for the exact slot names.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-05-06

Version realigned with the plugin DLL under the unified-versioning policy
("SDK 版本与插件版本保持统一"). The numeric
drop from `2.0.0` to `1.5.0` is a deliberate alignment with the plugin
release cadence, **not** a regression of any SDK feature or behavior.

The publishing-layout migration introduced in [2.0.0] (dist-only entry,
sub-path exports, archived hand-written files) remains in effect. No
SDK-level public API or behavior has changed since [2.0.0].

## [2.0.0] - 2026-05-05

This is a publishing-layout migration release. The runtime API surface
is **identical** to 1.4.x; consumers using the documented public exports
will not see behavioural changes. The breaking changes are limited to
package layout, deep file paths, and TypeScript module resolution.

### Changed (BREAKING)

- **Publishing entry switched to `./dist/`** — TypeScript SDK source
  (`sdk/src/**/*.ts`) is now built with `tsup` and published from
  `sdk/dist/`. The hand-written legacy top-level files
  (`sdk/bridge.js`, `sdk/index.d.ts`, `sdk/index.mjs`,
  `sdk/components.js`, `sdk/components.d.ts`, `sdk/smp-compat.js`,
  `sdk/smp/**/*.js`) have been moved out of the published package.
- **`package.json` exports rewritten**:
  - `main` / `module` → `./dist/bridge.js`
  - `types` → `./dist/index.d.ts`
  - `browser` → `./dist/bridge.global.js` (IIFE bundle)
  - Sub-paths: `./bridge`, `./components`, `./smp-compat` now resolve to
    `./dist/<name>.js`; new `./bridge.global`, `./components.global`,
    `./smp-compat.global` sub-paths expose the IIFE bundles for direct
    `<script>` consumption.
- **`files` array** reduced to `["dist", "LICENSE", "README.md", "CHANGELOG.md"]`.
- **Deep imports `foo-webview-sdk/smp/<class>.js` removed** — import the
  individual SMP wrapper classes from `foo-webview-sdk/smp-compat`
  instead (e.g. `import { FbMetadbHandle } from 'foo-webview-sdk/smp-compat'`).

### Removed

- The hand-written `sdk/bridge.js`, `sdk/components.js`,
  `sdk/smp-compat.js`, `sdk/smp/*`, `sdk/index.d.ts`, `sdk/index.mjs`,
  and `sdk/components.d.ts` files have been archived for historical
  reference and are no longer included in the npm package.
- The legacy namespace-parity check script has been removed; legacy ↔ TS
  namespace parity verification is no longer required after the migration.

### Migration guide

Most consumers do not need any code changes:

```js
// Continues to work — resolves to ./dist/bridge.js
import fb from 'foo-webview-sdk';
import { player, playlist } from 'foo-webview-sdk';
import 'foo-webview-sdk/components';
```

`<script>` tag consumers must update the file path:

```html
<!-- Before (1.x) -->
<script src="node_modules/foo-webview-sdk/bridge.js"></script>
<script src="node_modules/foo-webview-sdk/components.js"></script>

<!-- After (2.0) -->
<script src="node_modules/foo-webview-sdk/dist/bridge.global.js"></script>
<script src="node_modules/foo-webview-sdk/dist/components.global.js"></script>
```

Deep imports of SMP wrapper classes must be updated:

```js
// Before (1.x)
import { FbMetadbHandle } from 'foo-webview-sdk/smp/FbMetadbHandle.js';

// After (2.0)
import { FbMetadbHandle } from 'foo-webview-sdk/smp-compat';
```
