### fb2k_playlist_get_active

}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `index` | integer | Playlist index |

## Management

### fb2k_playlist_set_active 

Sets the active playlist.

- **Bridge method**: `playlist.setActive`

| Parameter | Type | Required | Constraints |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `playlist` | integer | Yes | Zero-based playlist index; minimum `0` |

### fb2k_playlist_create 

Creates an empty playlist.

- **Bridge method**: `playlist.create`

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | string | Yes | Playlist name |

### fb2k_playlist_remove 

Removes a playlist.

- **Bridge method**: `playlist.remove`

| Parameter | Type | Required | Constraints |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `playlist` | integer | Yes | Zero-based playlist index; minimum `0` |

## Track operations

### fb2k_playlist_get_tracks 

Gets a page of tracks from a playlist.

- **Bridge method**: `playlist.getTracks`

| Parameter | Type | Required | Constraints |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `playlist` | integer | No | Declared minimum `0`; defaults to the active playlist |
| `start` | integer | No | Declared minimum `0`; Bridge default `0` |
| `count` | integer | No | Declared range `1` to `500`; Bridge default `100` |

The `ToolDefinition` description currently says default `50`, but it declares no MCP default. Omission therefore reaches `playlist.getTracks`, whose handler uses `100`; that runtime behavior is documented here.

**Example result:**

```json
{
  "playlist": 0,
  "start": 0,
  "count": 2,
  "total": 128,
  "tracks": [
    {
      "index": 0,

    }
  ]
}
```
