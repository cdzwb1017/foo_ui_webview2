# fb.sharedState Cross-window Shared State

`fb.sharedState` exposes a cross-window key/value store. It is distinct from the synchronous `fb.state` playback mirror: shared-state values can be assigned a TTL and changes are published through the `state:*` event family.

### delete()

Signature: `fb.sharedState.delete(key: string): Promise<BaseResponse>`

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `key` | `string` | Yes | Logical key to remove. |

Returns the `state.delete` response envelope. A successful explicit removal emits `state:deleted` with `reason: 'deleted'`.

```javascript
const result = await fb.sharedState.delete('playlist:active-filter');
```

### keys()

Signature: `fb.sharedState.keys(pattern = '*'): Promise<{ keys: string[] }>`

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `pattern` | `string` | No | Key pattern; defaults to `'*'`. |

Returns the matching keys in `{ keys }`.

```javascript
const { keys } = await fb.sharedState.keys('playlist:*');
```

### set()

Signature: `fb.sharedState.set(key: string, value: unknown, silent = false, ttlMs?: number): Promise<BaseResponse>`

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `key` | `string` | Yes | Logical key to update. |
| `value` | `unknown` | Yes | JSON-serializable value. |
| `silent` | `boolean` | No | Suppresses the change event when `true`; defaults to `false`. |
| `ttlMs` | `number` | No | Time to live in milliseconds. |

Returns the `state.set` response envelope.

```javascript
await fb.sharedState.set('playlist:active-filter', 'favorites', false, 60_000);
```

## Additional Methods

### get()

`fb.sharedState.get(key: string): Promise<{ value: unknown }>` reads one value.

```javascript
const { value } = await fb.sharedState.get('playlist:active-filter');
```

## Events

- `fb.sharedState.onChange(handler)` subscribes to `state:changed` and returns an unsubscribe function. The typed payload is `StateChangedPayload<T>` with `key`, `value`, `previousValue`, `sourceWindowId`, and optional `expiresAt` fields.
- `fb.sharedState.onDelete(handler)` subscribes to `state:deleted` and returns an unsubscribe function. `StateDeletedPayload.reason` is either `'deleted'` or `'expired'`.

```javascript
const off = fb.sharedState.onChange(({ key, value }) => {
	console.log(key, value);
});

off();
```
