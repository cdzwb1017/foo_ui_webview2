# Event reference

Runtime event payload reference for foo_ui_webview2. Event names use **colon** format (`namespace:eventName`); method invocations use **dot** format (`namespace.method`).

Every payload key set is backed by a precise C++ emit-source rule. Internal `:__` events and historical entries without runtime emit evidence are excluded.

## app events

| Event | Payload keys |
| --- | --- |
| app:beforeQuit | `{}` |

## audio events

| Event | Payload keys |
| --- | --- |
| audio:dspPresetChanged | `{}` |
| audio:fullWaveformFailed | `{ code, error, path, taskId }` |
| audio:fullWaveformReady | `{ cached, channels, duration, method, path, resolution, sampleRate, scale, signed, taskId, waveform }` |
| audio:outputDeviceChanged | `{}` |
| audio:replaygainModeChanged | `{ mode }` |
| audio:spectrum | `{ spectrum }` |
| audio:stream | `{}` |

`audio:stream` is currently only a reserved token returned by the unimplemented stream-capture subscription stub; the runtime does not emit it.

## cursor events

| Event | Payload keys |
| --- | --- |
| cursor:hiddenChanged | `{ hidden }` |

## http events

| Event | Payload keys |
| --- | --- |
| http:downloadComplete | `{ bytesWritten, cancelled, code, error, path, requestId, status, success }` |
| http:response | `{ body, cancelled, code, contentLength, error, headers, requestId, responseType, status, success }` |

## jitQueue events

| Event | Payload keys |
| --- | --- |
| jitQueue:error | `{ error, path, trackId, url }` |
| jitQueue:listExhausted | `{ lastTrackId }` |
| jitQueue:needNext | `{ currentTrackId, reason }` |
| jitQueue:preloadComplete | `{ count, replace, startIndex }` |
| jitQueue:trackChanged | `{ title, trackId }` |

For `jitQueue:error`, local-file failures include `path`, while remote-source failures include `url`; exactly one of those two keys is present in each payload.

## Notes

- `playback:stopAfterCurrentChanged` uses `{ enabled }`, the same field as its API.
- Playlist lifecycle payloads are authoritative in `src/callbacks/PlaylistCallback.cpp`.
- The exact emit source and field set for every row follow the C++ `EmitEvent` / `BroadcastEvent` call sites in the component source.
