# Overview

> **Minimum foobar2000 version**: 2.0+

**foo_ui_webview2** is a foobar2000 component that replaces the default user interface with WebView2, so you can build custom UIs with modern web technologies (HTML/CSS/JavaScript).

::: tip Migrating from Spider Monkey Panel (SMP)?
v1.2.0 ships a full SMP compatibility layer, including:
- **35 SMP event mappings** — SMP names such as `on_playback_new_track` work directly
- **8 wrapper classes** — `FbMetadbHandle`, `FbTitleFormat`, `ContextMenuManager`, and more
- **Full `fb` / `plman` objects** — sync properties, playback control, and playlist management

How it works: a **cache + event** model wraps async APIs as sync properties to match SMP's sync semantics. This is an **eventual consistency** model (not strong consistency) and fits UI rendering. For precise transactional control, call the low-level `fb2k.invoke()` APIs directly. WARNING: SMP GDI/GDI+ drawing (`on_paint(gr)`, etc.) cannot migrate — rewrite the UI layer with HTML/CSS/Canvas. → [Full SMP compatibility docs](/reference/smp-compat)

## Design principles

> foo_ui_webview2 follows "the component provides capabilities; the app decides policy."

### Component responsibilities (provided by foo_ui_webview2)

| Category | Description | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| foobar2000 core capabilities | Playback, playlists, library, artwork | `playback.*`, `playlist.*` |
| Window management | DWM effects, caption, scaling | `window.*` |
| System integration | Files, dialogs, shell | `file.*`, `dialog.*` |
| Audio analysis | Spectrum and waveform | `audio.*` |
| Config storage | Persistent key-value storage | `config.*` |
| Streaming helpers | Generic URL playback, JIT queue | `jitQueue.*` |

### Application responsibilities (implemented by you)

| Category | Description | Why not in the component |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Online service integration | Spotify, NetEase, QQ Music, etc. | Auth and business flows differ |
| Multi-source lyrics aggregation | Online search and translation merge | Business logic |
| Artwork cache policy | Prefetch and LRU | Policy choice |
| UI theme and layout | Colors, fonts, animation | App-specific |

### Example: capability vs policy

```javascript
// Component capability: fetch artwork
await fb2k.invoke('artwork.getFb2kUrl', { path: trackPath, maxSize: 200 });

// App policy: prefetch / cache
function prefetchCovers(albums) {
    albums.forEach(album => {
        const img = new Image();
        img.src = `fb2k://artwork/${encodeURIComponent(album.path)}?maxSize=200`;
    });
}
```
